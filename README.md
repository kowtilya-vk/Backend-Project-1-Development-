# Regex Matcher – Tkinter Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple **GUI-based Regular Expression Matcher** built using **Python and Tkinter**.  
It replicates the **core functionality of regex101.com**, where users can enter a regular expression and a test string to find all matching patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To allow users to:
- Enter a **regular expression**
- Enter a **test string**
- Click a **Submit** button
- View **all matched strings** based on the given regex

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- `re` module (Regular Expressions)

---

## ✨ Features
- User-friendly graphical interface
- Supports all valid Python regular expressions
- Displays all matching substrings
- Handles invalid regex patterns gracefully
- Scrollable input and output text areas

---

## 🚀 How the Application Works
1. The user enters a **Regular Expression** in the input field.
2. The user enters a **Test String**.
3. On clicking the **Submit** button:
   - The regex is applied to the test string.
   - All matches are extracted using Python’s `re` module.
4. The matched strings are displayed in the output area.
5. If no match is found, an appropriate message is shown.
